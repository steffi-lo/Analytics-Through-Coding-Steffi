Medium-bodied and creamy, the Merlot gives this wine a feminine feel, despite solid, soft tannins. Dark, extracted black fruits have some accents of forest and black olive, while leather adds to the cherry and cassis nose. Could use time to soften further, but very approachable now.",

It's full bodied without seeming overly rich or heavy, framing the lush notes of dark berries, grilled meat, mint and licorice with supple tannins. Spice-driven flavors linger elegantly on the lengthy finish. It's delicious now, but should age gracefully through 2030.",

    "Summary functions allow us to quickly describe and understand a dataset by computing key statistics. Common examples include `.mean()`, `.median()`, `.min()`, `.max()`, and `.sum()` for numerical data, as well as `.value_counts()` for categorical data. These functions can be applied to entire DataFrames or specific columns, giving us insights such as average values, distributions, and totals. Using `.describe()` provides a convenient overview of multiple summary statistics at once.\n"
